# Dynamic Time Warping (DTS)
This Python notebook implements functions to calculate the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between sequences. The DTW algorithm measures the similarity between two sequences while considering variations in the time dimension. Current implementation offers two variants : with and without window constraint.
